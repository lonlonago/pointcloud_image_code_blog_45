#  First, the principle of the algorithm 

##  1. Algorithm overview 

   The principle of GICP algorithm is to combine ICP algorithm and Point-to-plane ICP into a probabilistic framework model, perform point cloud registration based on this framework, and play a role similar to weights through the covariance matrix to eliminate the role of some bad corresponding points in the solution process. GICP has a wider application range than standard ICP, and under certain conditions, the GICP algorithm degenerates into a standard ICP algorithm. At the same time, if there is a unique solution, the minimum point is the global optimal solution, and the GICP algorithm degenerates into a standard ICP algorithm. 

##  2. Algorithm flow 

   GICP is an extension of the "point-to-point" ICP and "point-to-plane" ICP methods. To improve the robustness of the registration, GICP uses the covariance matrix of the point cloud surface to construct the cost function of point cloud registration. Suppose we find two clusters of points in two 3D point clouds that are close neighbors to each other: = {} and = {}, where the sum matches each other. In probability theory, we assume that there are two clusters of points corresponding to each other = {} and = {}. So, it can be defined that the point cloud is generated by the following Gaussian distribution: Is the covariance matrix of each point. We define the rigid transformation matrix, and the registration error of each pair of corresponding points is as follows: because and belong to independent Gaussian distributions, then the distribution also belongs to the Gaussian distribution:
